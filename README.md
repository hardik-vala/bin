Some non-standard shell commands that make life easier.

So far, just includes two commands:
+ ddc - Counts the number of items in a directory
+ scpdoop - Transfers a file or directory to the HDFS directly in scp-style

I am by no means a shell-scripting pro so if you have other shell utilties I could use, or easier ways of implementing the existing commands, please feel free to drop me a line or even better, just fork or pull.
