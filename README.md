Some non-standard shell commands that make life easier.

So far, just includes two commands:
+ ctdocker - Copies a file into a Docker container
+ ddc - Counts the number of items in a directory
+ edit\_distance\_for\_tsv - Compute edit distance/string similiarity between entries in two columns of  a .tsv file
+ gcompress - gzip a given folder without having to remember the stupid options
+ guncompress - Un-gzip a given folder without having remember the stupid options
+ normalize - Normalize the text in a file (lowercase, crudely tokenize, etc.)
+ scpdoop - Transfers a file or directory to the HDFS directly in scp-style
+ wcc - Perform wc on just code, excluding comments

I am by no means a shell-scripting pro so if you have other shell utilties I could use, or easier ways of implementing the existing commands, please feel free to drop me a line or even better, just fork or pull.
